    "#### **Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial markets are highly sensitive to news and public sentiment, making accurate market predictions a challenging yet essential task for investors, analysts, and policymakers. Traditional methods of predicting stock market trends often rely on historical price data, technical indicators, and economic metrics, but they may overlook the impact of real-time news sentiment on market dynamics. This project aims to address this gap by leveraging the sentiment of headlines from the New York Times (NYT) and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) as a proxy for public and market sentiment. By analyzing how the tone and context of headlines correlate with movements in the S&P 500 index, we seek to uncover patterns that can complement existing predictive models. This approach reflects the growing importance of sentiment analysis in financial forecasting, recognizing the critical role that media and public perception play in shaping market behavior."

    "#### **Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for building a model to predict S&P 500 closing prices using the sentiments of New York Times (NYT) and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) headlines lies in the significant influence that public sentiment and news have on financial markets. Headlines often capture prevailing market sentiment, economic developments, and geopolitical events, which can drive investor behavior and, consequently, market movements. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in NYT headlines, we aim to extract valuable insights into market sentiment that could enhance traditional financial models. Integrating sentiment analysis with market prediction can improve the timeliness and accuracy of forecasts, providing a more comprehensive tool for investors and analysts to make informed decisions in a rapidly changing economic environment."

    "#### **Problem Statement** \n",
    "\n",
    "Using various sentiment analysis methods (VADER, TextBlob, BERT), we aim to compute sentiment scores for NYT headlines and WSJ headline between 1998 and 2020. Each headline includes a date and section field as well. NYT headlines were collected from 1990 to 2020 (avoiding harder to predict post-COVID fluctuations in the market). WSJ headlines were collected from 1998 to 2021. For this reason, we will use the years in overlap to perform sentiment analysis (1998 - 2020). Subsequent S&P 500 data closing prices have been collected at each time period during this timeframe, and we scaled these values to account for inflation."

    "We created a dataframe with an entry for each time point. For that time point, we average the sentiment scores for that day, and also add the number of headlines from each section into the row. Finally, our response is the S&P 500 closing price.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sentiment analysis, we used three different methods - VADER and TextBlob and BERT - to give a score to each NYT and WSJ article headline. Due to the short nature of each headline (on average 6 words or less), the majority of scores are 0, thus we exclude sentiment scores of 0 in order to assess either a positive or negative value for the time period - we will experiment with this threshold. It should be noted that there are many more headlines for the WSJ compared to the NYT, so we could only perform BERT on the WSJ enteries due to the computational time to incorporate this model. After testing multiple time points in milestones 4, we concluded that the average sentiment analysis for each month worked best to predict the S&P 500. This means we have a df where each row is a day date (averaged sentiment scores for that day and S&P closing price for that day), week (averaged sentiment scores for that day and averaged S&P closing price for that week) and so on."

    "#### **Datasets** \n",

    "1. Kaggle Wall Street Journal: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amogh7joshi/wsj-headline-classification/data\n",
    "\n",
    "    The dataset consists of over 19,000 headlines scraped from the Wall Street Journal archives, spanning the period from May 3, 1998, to June 30, 2021. The headlines are organized into 67 categories based on the Wall Street Journal's classification system, making the dataset a valuable resource for tasks such as news category classification and unsupervised clustering. Headlines were randomly sampled (3-4 per day) and categorized, with categories containing fewer than 100 entries removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Kaggle New York Times: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnbandy/new-york-times-headlines\n",
    "\n",
    "    This dataset contains headlines from articles published by The New York Times between 1990 and 2020, along with accompanying metadata such as author, URL, word count, section, and more. It was created in July 2021 using The New York Times Article Search API. While it provides a comprehensive archive for text analysis and research, some records may have incomplete data due to API limitations.\n",

    "For our **S&P closing prices**, we are using Python’s built-in Yahoo Finance function (yfinance) to pull historical stock market data and storing it in a dataframe."
